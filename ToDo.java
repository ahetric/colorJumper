public class ToDo {

- choose pretty default colors (add dice option to shuffle initial colors) [fix efficiency of this]
- add a "get complement" option, which keeps initial color same and sets midpoint to #808080

- find a way to deal w weird combos (mod or force to 0xff or 0x00)? [only choose 'good' starting values for shuffle, like within margin]

- deal with square label font size and overall window size adjustment
- add instructions button at the bottom (or maybe menu)

- make it into a jar?

-when done w colorJumper_Swatches and ColorPickerSample, delete HexColorJumper's getR1_int(), getR2_int(), getRfinal()
